                                                                                                          Programs on structures.
                                                                    Write a program to accept and display month name, abbreviation and number of days. Use the concept of structure.
Example Output:
December abbreviated as Dec has 31 days

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
typedef struct month
{
char name[10];
char abbr[4];
int days;
}MONTH;
main()
{
MONTH m;
strcpy(m.name, "January");
strcpy(m.abbr, "Jan");
m.days=31;
printf("%s abbreviated as %s has %d days\n", m.name, m.abbr, m.days);
}
